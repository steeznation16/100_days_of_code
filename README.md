# 100_days_of_code
Repository for 100 Days of Code Challenge starting on May 1, 2019

### This Repository:

The Flatiron School is hosting a 100 Days of Code Challenge that I began on May 1, 2019.  This README, as well as associated notebooks will hold my daily code, as well as any projects or ideas I choose to tackle during the time.  As I add new ideas or projects, I will update this README appropriately.
